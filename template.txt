NOTICE: This whois information is completely fake, and is only intended
to be used as a demonstration as to the simplicity and silliness of the
established whois system. It took me 10 minutes, with little previous
knowledge of node.js, to develop this fake whois service.

For an enlightening look into the history, design, and function of whois,
check out this page on Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whois

Also note that this whois server is not compliant with the whois RFC.
Like I said, I wrote it in about 10 minutes. Feel free to fork it on github
and fill in the missing functionality in order to become RFC-compliant.
